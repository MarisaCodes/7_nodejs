# Making a primitive blog web app using Express, EJS, and Mongodb

---

### What I used

- Nodejs/Express used for the backend
- EJS is the templating engine used
- morgan middleware used to display server info when it receives requests
- Mongodb database was setup locally
- Mongoose package used to interact with mongodb (schemas and models)
- ignore the mongodb package, was not used (only used initially for testing purposes)

---

### How to run

- clone repo or download .zip
- `npm install`
- `npm start` at the root of the project
- won't work if Mongodb is not available locally or if the Mongodb connection url is different from mine
